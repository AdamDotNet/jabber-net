What license applies to Jabber-Net?

= History =

Jabber-Net was originally developed with the intent of being used under the Jabber Open Source License (JOSL).  A copy of JOSL is still available [http://archive.jabber.org/core/JOSL.pdf here], or in the [http://code.google.com/p/jabber-net/source/browse/trunk/LICENSE.txt LICENSE.txt] file that is a part of the Jabber-Net source.

Due to requests from various open source projects that wanted to include Jabber-Net as a part of their programs, the [http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/info/GPLv2.html GPLv2] license was added as an option several years ago, leaving Jabber-Net available under either GPLv2 or JOSL, at the discretion of the organization using the code.

= Commercial Support =

As of February, 2008, Jabber Inc. will provide commercial licensing and support of Jabber-Net.  This will consist of:
