#summary How come I get a certificate error?

In Mono, you get this error:

{{{
ERROR: System.IO.IOException: The authentication or decryption has failed. ---> Mono.Security.Protocol.Tls.TlsException: Invalid certificate received form server.
}}}

With .Net 2.0, you get:

{{{
TODO: fill in error
}}}

This means that your server has an SSL/TLS certificate that is not signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) that your system trusts.  You can either fix the certificate problem (preferred), or set:

{{{
bedrock.net.AsyncSocket.UntrustedRootOK = true;
}}}
